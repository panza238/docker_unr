# Docker: Up and Running

As mentioned in `README.md`, we will be following along with the book "Docker: Up and Running" by Sean P. Kane. This roadmap is meant to explain the main concepts discussed in the book, and how they are implemented here.<br>
Also, since the idea it to take a hands-on approach, we will start at chapter 4.

## Chapter 04: Working with Docker Images
