# Docker: Up and Running
The code in this repository is meant to serve as a sample project to follow along Sean P. Kane's book "Docker: Up and Running" (Published by O'Reilly).<br>
Since the idea is to take on a hands-on approach, the first few chapters will be skipped. We will take chapter 4 as the starting point. However, I do recommend reading the previous chapters. They go over how Docker works and as well as it's strengths and weaknesses. 
Understanding these things might help further down the line, especially when it comes to debugging.<br>
That's enough of an introduction. Let's dive in!
